# ProjectNoAndroidStudio
## This app is built without Android Studio

![Screen](screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot")

### It was created using:
1. Sublime Text Editor
2. Gradle (wrapper)
3. Android SDK
4. JDK
5. Command line to run the gradle commands
6. Many (but carefully chosen) copy pasted files from my HelloAndroid project.

### Why did I make this app?
Android Studio is a capable IDE leaving us with little to do; this leads us to an illusion of things happening by magic.
By building this app from scratch (kind of), I came across issues and observations that helped me understand:

1. how files should be arranged in a directory,
2. issues with incorrectly written AndroidManifest.xml file
3. how to generate a gradle wrapper and the files and directories generated by the gradle.
4. packaging of an apk is handled by a gradle task.
5. the Run button executes a series of gradle and adb commands that install and launch the app on your phone.

Having demystified Android Studioâ€™s magic, I am now curious to break down the workings of Gradle and Android SDK.

Hope you all found this interesting.
